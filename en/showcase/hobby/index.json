Back than I helped to solve the Milleniumbug. Now my experience includes Home and Office Automation, Cloud, E-commerce, System Administration. In free time I hobby in Cloud Computing. I work on webapps here and there to help out peers. I\u0026rsquo;m open to oppurtunities and challenging projects.\nThankfully I\u0026rsquo;ve been brought up bilingual. So i\u0026rsquo;m taught to always make the link and build the bridge. And how to compromise in cultural differences (dependencies among people) to work around these difficulties. I\u0026rsquo;m after innovation in life, big or small. My creativity is limitless.\n   Support my blog.\n You\u0026rsquo;ll have a look into my life, what I work on and what I care for.\nEnjoy.\n— Suberpower1 while devising this techblog2 in the winter of 2018.\n My hardware My computer keyboard costs more than my computer. Is it that my expenses have become outragious? Or is it that computing power costs a lot less these days?\nLaptops My main laptop is a ThinkPad X230, released in 2012. I bought mine secondhand via a local classified advertisement website, and it included the Ultrabase dockingstation, which I use at home daily for working at the desk. Old ThinkPads are designed for long term corporate use and lasts forever due to the inner roll cage.\nMy secundary laptop is a GPD Pocket 2, released in 2018. I received this as a test device for my participation in GPD Linux configuration and driver development project (Shenzhen) and have kept it ever since. This laptop is cute (7” display) until you hook it up on a monitor. This Pocketmonster is great for on the go.\nNetwork Monitor I’ve setup an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to monitor network traffic at home. In my attempt to master Network Security, I’ve deployed my IDS at an old Thinkpad (X61). I’m thinking about to replace it for more computing power as the IDS tends to hog the CPU.\nKeyboards How would my keyboard cost more than my laptop, you wonder? I tend to spend a fortune on these things, ten times higher. My keyboard is a custom NIZ Micro 82 EC-Ble. It’s an electro capacitive keyboard with custom BKE Redux at 45 grams and custom SA high profile keycaps. I do computing work 12 hours daily on average. As I do, I lay my fingers on these devices and aspire to compute at the highest level of comfort as possible. Or maybe i’m just a geek. Or not maybe, I just am.\nI think the sweetspot of keyboard layout is at 75%. The loss of numpad makes up for deskspace and I find it easier to align my body posture to the computer screen. I use a custom calculator (with MX cherry blue keyswitches) for touchtyping in digits via Bluetooth.\nPointing Devices Apple Magic Trackpad (2) above any other pointing device, period. After all these years, I still can’t get my hands around a mouse. It forces my arm in a very unnatural position as I feel my arm and neck complaining. This is why I find the trackpad awesome: precision and gestures. I’m nowhere slower and the gestures adds a new dimension to desktop and browser control.\nI used to use a Logitech MX Anywhere lasermouse for gaming but unfortunately haven’t found time to do desktop gaming lately.\nMy Software These are the programs I run on the computer. The listed programs are used for a while and considered as tried and true, there are no other (my favourites).\nOperating system I use Linux Void, an independent distribution developed entirely by volunteers. Unlike most other distros, Void is not a modification of an existing distribution. It’s package manager and build system have been written from scratch. If you happen to feel like distrohopping and want to try out one without systemd and glibc, than take this green pill. I’ve hopped on this distro since 2018 and never looked back.\nShell Recently I’ve been using zsh instead of bash. For it’s recursive path expansion, “/u/lo/b” expands to “/usr/local/bin”. It’s basically the bash for modern days with extension plug-ins.\nTerminal URxvt (rxvt-unicode) is a fork of rxvt. I use this because it’s fast, lean and fairly customizable. I’ve spent time on the newer GPU-powered terminals like Alacritty and Hyper but this unique feature of URxvt draws me back everytime: it can run as a daemon to save memory output.\nWindow Manager I have no Desktop Manager (KDE/GNOME etc…) but use a Window Manager like i3-gaps instead. This makes me able to control my windows with keyboard only. My windows, wether I want them in full-screen or split-screen, are just a few keystrokes away.\nMy taskbar is based on polybar. It’s shows date and time, battery, volume, wifi, bluetooth, is easy extensible and configurable.\nText Editor My main tool. I would rather have a good text editor and nothing else. I use Visual Code (with disabled telematry) and vanilla vim for everything else.\nWeb Browser Firefox is a safer standard browser. It blocks cryptomining scripts and social trackers. Chromium as secundary for page translation. I watch browsh and qutebrowser closely and use them from time to time.\nFile Manager I manage my files in the terminal with ranger. Very customizable and efficient, it has vim-like console and hotkeys.\nI do use a file manager with GUI for drag and drop stuff: Nemo. Just for it’s looks.\nMail Client Nowadays rich e-mail is the norm. Mutt takes e-mail back to it’s essentials, no text formatting and no images. It’s good for scripting. I use this for sending alerts from my IDS.\nRSS Reader Newsboat. The internet has been blown up by all bells and whistle. It’s better to keep up with the internet through RSS to skip all cookies and ads. Bonus: I browse Youtube channels through RSS and watch videos without having to open a browser.\nSpreadsheet Spreadsheets can be done in the terminal with sc-im. I’m taught to use Excel but all the basic things I do in Excel can be done in sc-im.\nPDF Viewer Zathura opens PDF files instantly. I also use it as a preview window for writing in Markdown. It’s cool to write in Markdown, it’s portable and it’s format is easily converted into a webpage, Word document or yes… a PDF file.\nPhoto Editor GIMP. Although I do all my graphic works on a Mac (Photoshop CS), GIMP comes close. GIMP does almost everything Adobe CS does and my transition was negligible.\nLast but not least Feel free to drop a line or two if we are like-minded.\nHire me  \nResume : Curriculum Vitae\nDonate now  \nDonation : Keeps me going\n Heb je na aanleiding van het lezen behoefte aan contact?

I’ll start off writing about using Linux as main OS for home computing, with some guides and reviews. Cloud and Security topics are being prepared to add sparkles to this techblog. Oh, and in case you’re wondering: Yes, I accept donations for coffee (for writing in the late hours). \u0026lt;3\nHardware I use When my peers see my stuff they wonder how my keyboard cost more than my laptop. And how I would love an Apple Magic Trackpad while avoiding Apple iCloud.\nLaptops My main laptop is a ThinkPad X230, released in 2012. I bought mine secondhand via a local classified advertisement website, and it included the ThinkPad Ultrabase, which I use at home daily for working at the desk. Old ThinkPads are designed for long term corporate use and lasts forever due to the inner roll cage.\nThe secundary laptop is a GPD Pocket 2, released in 2018. I received this as a test device for my participation in GPD Linux configuration and driver development project (Shenzhen) and have kept it ever since. This laptop is cute (7” display) until you hook it up on a monitor. This Pocketmonster is great for on the go.\nNetwork Monitor I’ve setup an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to monitor network traffic at home. In my attempt to master Network Security, I’ve deployed my IDS at an old Thinkpad (X61). I’m thinking about to replace it for more computing power as the IDS tends to hog the CPU.\nKeyboards How would my keyboard cost more than my laptop, you wonder? While the average “Keyboard and Mouse” setup cost around 20-30 Euros, I tend to spend a fortune on these things. My keyboard at desk is a custom NIZ Micro 82 EC-Ble. It’s an electro capacitive keyboard with custom BKE Redux at 45 grams and custom SA high profile keycaps. I do computing work 12 hours a day on average. As I do, I lay my fingers on these devices and aspire to compute at the highest level of comfort as possible. Or maybe i’m just a geek. Or not maybe, I just am.\nI think the sweetspot of keyboard layouts is at 75%. The loss of numpad makes up for space and I find it easier to align my body posture to the computer screen. I use a custom calculator (with MX cherry blue keyswitches) for touchtyping in digits via Bluetooth.\nPointing Devices Apple Magic Trackpad (2) above any other pointing device, period. After all these years, I still can’t get my hands around a mouse (pun intended). It forces my arm in a very unnatural position as I feel my arm and neck complaining. This is why I find the trackpad awesome: precision and gestures. I’m nowhere slower and the gestures adds a new dimension to desktop and browser control.\nI used to use a Logitech MX Anywhere lasermouse for gaming but unfortunately haven’t found time to do desktop gaming lately.\nSoftware I use These are the programs for my computing needs. The listed programs are used for a while and considered as tried and true, there is no other (my favourites).\nOperating system I use Linux Void, an independent distribution developed entirely by volunteers. Unlike most other distros, Void is not a modification of an existing distribution. It’s package manager and build system have been written from scratch. If you happen to feel like distrohopping and want to try out one without systemd and glibc, than take this green pill. I’ve hopped on this distro since 2018 and never looked back.\nShell Recently I’ve been using zsh instead of bash. For it’s recursive path expansion, “/u/lo/b” expands to “/usr/local/bin”. It’s basically the bash for modern days with extension plug-ins.\nTerminal URxvt (rxvt-unicode) is a fork of rxvt. I use this because it’s fast, lean and fairly customizable. I’ve spent time on the newer GPU-powered terminals like Alacritty and Hyper but this unique feature of URxvt draws me back everytime: it can run as a daemon to save memory output.\nWindow Manager I have no Desktop Manager (KDE/GNOME etc…) but use a Window Manager like i3-gaps instead. This makes me able to control my windows with keyboard only. My windows, wether I want them full-screen or split-screen, are just a few keystrokes away.\nMy taskbar is based on polybar. It’s shows date and time, battery, volume, wifi, bluetooth, is easy extensible and configurable.\nText editing and programming I use two text editors: vim and OSS code. I mainly use vim vanilla but for projects I prefer OSS code for it’s plug-in library.\nWeb Browser Firefox is a safer standard browser. It blocks cryptomining scripts and social trackers. Chromium as secundary. If it wasn’t for it’s page translation feature, I would have not been using Chromium alongside.\nFile Manager I manage my files in the terminal with ranger. Very customizable and efficient, it has vim-like console and hotkeys.\nI do use a file manager with GUI for drag and drop stuff: Nemo. Just for it’s looks.\nMail Client Nowadays rich e-mail is the norm. Mutt takes e-mail back to it’s essentials, no text formatting and no images. It’s good for scripting, to automate sending e-mails. I use this for sending e-mailalerts from my IDS.\nRSS Reader Newsboat. The internet has been blown up by all bells and whistle. It’s better to keep up with the internet through RSS to skip all cookies and ads. Bonus: I browse Youtube channels through RSS and watch videos without having to open a browser.\nSpreadsheet Spreadsheets can be done in the terminal with sc-im. I’m taught to use Excel but all the basic things I do in Excel can be done in sc-im.\nPDF Viewer Zathura opens PDF files instantly. I also use it as a preview window for writing in Markdown. It’s cool to write in Markdown, it’s portable and it’s format is easily converted into a webpage, Word document or yes… a PDF file.\nImage modification GIMP. Although I do all my graphic works on a Mac (Photoshop CS), GIMP comes close. GIMP does mostly everything Photoshop does for my use and with Photoshop keyboard shortcuts in GIMP, the transition is negligible.\nAbout me I’m suberpower, the writer of this blog.\nI started computing on a 486 DOS PC and quickly became a computer admin at young age. Now my experience includes Office Automation, Monitoring Systems, Cloud Apps, API integrations, E-commerce, System Administration. In free time I hobby in Home Automation and launch a website here and there to help out peers. I’m available for full-time occupation.
