Is it that my expenses have become outragious? Or is it that computing power costs a lot less these days?\n电脑 My main laptop is a ThinkPad X230, released in 2012. I bought mine secondhand via a local classified advertisement website, and it included the Ultrabase dockingstation, which I use at home daily for working at the desk. Old ThinkPads are designed for long term corporate use and lasts forever due to the inner roll cage.\nMy secundary laptop is a GPD Pocket 2, released in 2018. I received this as a test device for my participation in GPD Linux configuration and driver development project (Shenzhen) and have kept it ever since. This laptop is cute (7” display) until you hook it up on a monitor. This Pocketmonster is great for on the go.\n网络监控器 I’ve setup an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to monitor network traffic at home. In my attempt to master Network Security, I’ve deployed my IDS at an old Thinkpad (X61). I’m thinking about to replace it for more computing power as the IDS tends to hog the CPU.\n键盘 How would my keyboard cost more than my laptop, you wonder? I tend to spend a fortune on these things, ten times higher. My keyboard is a custom NIZ Micro 82 EC-Ble. It’s an electro capacitive keyboard with custom BKE Redux at 45 grams and custom SA high profile keycaps. I do computing work 12 hours daily on average. As I do, I lay my fingers on these devices and aspire to compute at the highest level of comfort as possible. Or maybe i’m just a geek. Or not maybe, I just am.\nI think the sweetspot of keyboard layout is at 75%. The loss of numpad makes up for deskspace and I find it easier to align my body posture to the computer screen. I use a custom calculator (with MX cherry blue keyswitches) for touchtyping in digits via Bluetooth.\n鼠标 Apple Magic Trackpad (2) above any other pointing device, period. After all these years, I still can’t get my hands around a mouse. It forces my arm in a very unnatural position as I feel my arm and neck complaining. This is why I find the trackpad awesome: precision and gestures. I’m nowhere slower and the gestures adds a new dimension to desktop and browser control.\nI used to use a Logitech MX Anywhere lasermouse for gaming but unfortunately haven’t found time to do desktop gaming lately.\n我用的软件 These are the programs I run on the computer. The listed programs are used for a while and considered as tried and true, there are no other (my favourites).\n操作系统 I use Linux Void, an independent distribution developed entirely by volunteers. Unlike most other distros, Void is not a modification of an existing distribution. It’s package manager and build system have been written from scratch. If you happen to feel like distrohopping and want to try out one without systemd and glibc, than take this green pill. I’ve hopped on this distro since 2018 and never looked back.\n命令提示符 Recently I’ve been using zsh instead of bash. For it’s recursive path expansion, “/u/lo/b” expands to “/usr/local/bin”. It’s basically the bash for modern days with extension plug-ins.\n电脑终端 URxvt (rxvt-unicode) is a fork of rxvt. I use this because it’s fast, lean and fairly customizable. I’ve spent time on the newer GPU-powered terminals like Alacritty and Hyper but this unique feature of URxvt draws me back everytime: it can run as a daemon to save memory output.\n窗口管理器 I have no Desktop Manager (KDE/GNOME etc…) but use a Window Manager like i3-gaps instead. This makes me able to control my windows with keyboard only. My windows, wether I want them in full-screen or split-screen, are just a few keystrokes away.\nMy taskbar is based on polybar. It’s shows date and time, battery, volume, wifi, bluetooth, is easy extensible and configurable.\n文字程序 My main tool. I would rather have a good text editor and nothing else. I use Visual Code (with disabled telematry) and vanilla vim for everything else.\n浏览器 Firefox is a safer standard browser. It blocks cryptomining scripts and social trackers. Chromium as secundary for page translation. I watch browsh and qutebrowser closely and use them from time to time.\n文件管理器 I manage my files in the terminal with ranger. Very customizable and efficient, it has vim-like console and hotkeys.\nI do use a file manager with GUI for drag and drop stuff: Nemo. Just for it’s looks.\n邮件程序 Nowadays rich e-mail is the norm. Mutt takes e-mail back to it’s essentials, no text formatting and no images. It’s good for scripting. I use this for sending alerts from my IDS.\nRSS读者器 Newsboat. The internet has been blown up by all bells and whistle. It’s better to keep up with the internet through RSS to skip all cookies and ads. Bonus: I browse Youtube channels through RSS and watch videos without having to open a browser.\n计算表程序 Spreadsheets can be done in the terminal with sc-im. I’m taught to use Excel but all the basic things I do in Excel can be done in sc-im.\nPDF程序 Zathura opens PDF files instantly. I also use it as a preview window for writing in Markdown. It’s cool to write in Markdown, it’s portable and it’s format is easily converted into a webpage, Word document or yes… a PDF file.\n图片修改器 GIMP. Although I do all my graphic works on a Mac (Photoshop CS), GIMP comes close. GIMP does almost everything Adobe CS does and my transition was negligible.\n还有这些东西 志趣相投的随时联系。\n招我做新成员  \n个人简历表 : 下载\n现在汇款  \n我接受捐款 : 让我继续前进 加油\n 阅读后需要 联系 我? 请选择适合您的 联系方式。 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 好奇我的小博客使用什么堆栈程序桩 程序桩？ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"About Page","id":19,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"关于","uri":"https://tausiekai.github.io/sbr/zh/about/"},{"content":"Suberpower 您好, 我是Suberpower(超爆阿)。这技术博客的作者。\n我是在个开486 DOS电脑上开始玩电脑的，并很快就成为个系统管理员。小时候, 在公司帮助解决千年虫。我的经验现在包括家庭和办公室自动化，云，系统管理和电子商务。有空的时候，我喜欢在网上打电脑，设计云程序。为了帮别人，到处都提供帮助开发Web应用，云程式等等。我乐于接受挑战性的项目。\n幸好小时候学到了多种语言和文化，还有西方的思维。在欧洲成长的，学到什么叫建立联系，什么叫架桥。如何妥协文化差异，怎样去解决困难。 我在生活中寻找创新, 大或小都好吧。我的创力是无限的。\n   赞助 我这小博客嘞。\n 给您看我怎么活，在做什么，关心什么。\n希望你喜欢。\n— Suberpower1 (超爆阿) 在设计这博客2，2018年冬季。\n 我用的硬件 My computer keyboard costs more than my computer.
